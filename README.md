# Summary 
Open source implementation of USP (User Services Platform) controller based on Broadband Forum's [USP](https://usp.technology) Specification.

## Background
So far most of the residential broadband devices e.g. Residential Gateways and Routers are being remotely managed by TR-069 based ACS (Auto configuration server) controllers or by proprietary software.

User Services Platform ([USP](https://usp.technology)) is a standardized framework to remotely manage networked devices (RGs, IoT Devices) through standard protocols as defined by [TR-369a2](https://usp.technology/specification/index.html).

OpenUSP is an Apache Licensed 2.0 repository, written primarily in [golang](https://go.dev).
